# Teaching Mastery Course Data Visualization
## Introduction
Welcome to Teaching Mastery Course Data Visualization Project. This project is a data visualization work from my role as a Data Analyst Volunteer at MIND - Mentoring in New Dimensions, a youth organization that provides innovative and impactful education and leadership training.
## Background
The Teaching Mastery Course dataset is a real dataset collected from students who attended the course. It comprises data from three distinct forms: the registration form, the attendance form, and the feedback form.
## Quick Link
- Data source: I will not provide the dataset, as it contains data belonging to the organization.
- Data Visualization: [Visualizations](Visualizations.md) I have obtained permission from the organization to upload the visualization.
## Business Task
To uncover actionable insights that the organization could use to improve student engagement, retention strategies, and course effectiveness.
## Analysis Questions
-	What are the key demographic characteristics of students attending the course?
- How does student attendance vary across different course days?
- What factors contribute to student dropouts or absences?
- How satisfied are students with the course based on feedback and ratings?
- What occupations benefit the most from this course?
- How can the organization improve retention and participation rates?
- What strategies can be implemented to attract more students from underrepresented locations?
## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source: I will not provide the dataset, as it contains data belonging to the organization.
## Process
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing. 
The Attendance and Feedback datasets are already clean, while the Registration dataset requires some minor cleaning.
### Data Cleaning
In the Registration dataset, I made changes to the Current Residence column to standardize entries, as students had written them in different languages and with varying capitalization.
### Analyze and Share
I use Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
