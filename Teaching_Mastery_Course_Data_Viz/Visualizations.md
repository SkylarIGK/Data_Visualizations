The majority of students are from Yangon, while only a few are from other regions. Expanding marketing efforts to other regions could help increase participation from diverse locations.

Most students are teachers, followed by students, with only one working professional. To attract a wider audience, the organization could adjust its promotion strategy to reach more working professionals.

Some students had periods of absence, and a few left the course early. Most active day is Day 1 and most absent on Day 7. Understanding why students were absent or left could help improve course retention. The organization might consider sending follow-up emails or conducting short exit surveys.

Only 2 out of 8 students provided feedback. Encouraging more students to share their thoughts—perhaps through incentives or simplifying the feedback process—can provide valuable insights for future improvements.

All students who provided feedback gave a perfect rating. While this is positive, gathering more detailed feedback through surveys or discussions could provide deeper insights for improvement.
