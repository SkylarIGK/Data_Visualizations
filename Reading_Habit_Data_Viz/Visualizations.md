Both males and females enjoy a variety of book genres, but some preferences differ. Fiction, Fantasy, and Science are equally popular among both genders. However, males tend to read more Biography books and Self-Help books, while females show a preference for Romance. This insight can help publishers and bookstores tailor recommendations based on gender preferences.

On average, females read more per week (5.39 hours) than males (3.88 hours). This indicates a potential difference in reading habits between genders, which could be explored further by looking at specific genres or motivations for reading.

The Mature Adult (30–40) group reads the most, spending around 80 hours weekly, followed by the Early Adult (20–25) group at 73 hours. In contrast, Teenagers (under 20) and Seniors (over 40) read the least, around 45 and 43 hours, respectively. This suggests that reading engagement is highest in the early and mid-career phases of adulthood, possibly due to work, self-improvement, or leisure reading habits.

Most book genres have a positive impact on mood, with Fantasy, Romance, and Fiction being the top genres associated with a positive mood. On the other hand, Science and Biography books have a more balanced impact, with some readers feeling neutral or even negative after reading. This insight can be useful for recommending books that boost emotional well-being.

Different age groups prefer different genres. Younger readers (Teenagers & Early Adults) prefer Fantasy and Fiction, while Mature Adults (30–40) and Seniors (over 40) enjoy a wider range, including History, Biography, and Romance. This pattern suggests that book recommendations can be customized by age group for better engagement.

People who experience a positive mood after reading tend to read the most (6.65 hours per week), while those with a neutral or negative mood read significantly less (2.56 and 1.25 hours, respectively). This suggests that enjoying books and feeling emotionally uplifted encourages longer reading sessions.

Meanwhile, Science (2.10 hours) and Biography (1.50 hours) have the lowest reading times. This suggests that engaging storytelling genres keep readers invested for longer durations.
