# Reading Habits Data Visualization Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Reading Habits Data Visualization Project. This project will showcases the skills that I have learned. I will analyze Reading Habits dataset to explore interesting insights by using Power BI. 
## Background
The Reading Habits Dataset is a synthetic dataset designed to practice data analysis. It contains information about individualsâ€™ reading preferences, weekly reading time, and its reported impact on their mood.

## Business Task
This dataset can help businesses personalize book recommendations by analyzing reading habits and mood impact, enhancing customer engagement for bookstores and subscription services. It also enables targeted marketing by identifying popular genres and optimizing promotions based on user preferences. Additionally, insights from the dataset can support mental wellness initiatives, library curation, and content strategies for book review platforms.
## Analysis Questions
-	What are the most popular book genres among males and females?
- Is there a significant difference in reading preferences between genders?
- How does reading time vary across different age groups?
- How does reading affect mood? (Do certain book genres lead to more positive mood impacts?)
- What is the relationship between weekly reading hours and mood impact?
- Do certain genres contribute more to positive mood impact compared to others?
- Which book genres have the highest average weekly reading hours?
- How do different age groups prefer different book genres?
## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source: [Reading-Habits-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/reading-habits-and-mood-impact-dataset) [accessed on 9/2/2025]. It is a synthetic dataset which includes key details such as User ID, Age, Gender, Facorite Book Genre, Weekly Reading Time (Hour), Mood Impact.
## Process
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing. 
There is no null values in any column and dataset is already clean.
### Data Cleaning
I make new column (AgeGroup) from Age column. I made conditional column in Power BI as follow: Teenage (under 20), Early Adult (20-25), Mid Adult (25-30) and Mature Adult (30-40), Seniors (over 40).
### Analyze and Share
I use Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
