# Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Project. This project will showcases the skills that I have learned. I will analyze Retail Sales and Customer Demographic dataset to explore interesting insights by using data analysis process. 
## Background
The Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset is a synthetic dataset designed to emulate a dynamic retail environment, offering an excellent platform for honing data analysis skills through exploratory data analysis (EDA). This dataset focuses on retail sales and customer characteristics, providing opportunities to uncover patterns, derive insights, and better understand customer behavior.

## Business Task
To uncover actionable insights that retailers could use to enhance their strategies and customer experiences.
## Analysis Questions
-	How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
-	Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
-	Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
-	What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?

## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source: [retail-sales-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset) [accessed on 26/12/2024]. It is a synthetic dataset which includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount.
## Process
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing. 
There is no null values in any column and dataset is already clean.
### Data Cleaning
I make new column (Age group) from Age column. I made conditional column in Power BI as follow: Young Adult (18-25), Adult (26-35), Old Adult (36-50) and Old (over 50).
### Analyze and Share
I use Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
