# LAS (Lead, Achieve, Succeed) Training Registration Form Data Visualization
## Introduction
Welcome to LAS (Lead, Achieve, Succeed) Training Registration Form Data Visualization Project. This project is a data visualization work from my role as a Data Analyst Volunteer at MIND - Mentoring in New Dimensions, a youth organization that provides innovative and impactful education and leadership training.
## Background
The LAS (Lead, Achieve, Succeed) Training Registration Form dataset is a real dataset collected from students who attended the course.
## Quick Link
- Data source: I will not provide the dataset, as it contains data belonging to the organization.
- Data Visualization: [Visualizations](Visualizations.md) I have obtained permission from the organization to upload the visualization.
## Business Task
To uncover actionable insights that the organization could use to improve student registration rate.
## Analysis Questions
-	What is the most common age range among the students?
- How many students have joined MINDâ€™s training before?
- Which region has the highest number of students currently living there?
- What is the most common occupation among the students?
- What are the main motivations for students enrolling in this training?
- How many students enrolled because of self-development versus other reasons?
- Do students from certain regions show a higher tendency to join the training?
## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source: I will not provide the dataset, as it contains data belonging to the organization.
## Process
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing. 
### Data Cleaning
I made changes to the Current Living State column and what motivate you to enroll this column to standardize entries, as students had written them in different languages, long sentences and with varying capitalization.
### Analyze and Share
I use Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
